I start working at `X Company` in June 2019, but then the `Covid-19` outbreak got worse the the  office had to shut down. I thought that this outbreak would slow down and things would start to get better within a few months, but I was wrong. `Covid-19` has definitely changed my life and everyone. Some companies have even allowed their employees to work from home forever.

What I like about working from home is that I donâ€™t have to wake up really early in order to think about my commute to work. Hanoi traffic can be one of the worst, it takes me up to an hour just to get there. Instead, I donâ€™t have to think about that anymore. I just need to walk to my desk once Iâ€™m ready to work! Now letâ€™s talk about a typical workday from home.

## 05:00 AM
This is the time that I wake up for exercise, eat breakfast and shower.

## 07:00 AM
Once I'm done with my personal tasks, I'll turn on my computer to listen to some `lofi music` early in the morning and read the latest news of the day.

## 08:30 AM
The first thing I do right before I start working is that I make yourself a cup of coffee - check & reply Email (I will spend 5â€“15 minutes on).

I open up my calendar and task board. A sprint board contains the tasks that I am currently working on. Once I check, I go ahead and start working on the work items on my sprint board. I open up my timer and working on for 45 minutes, then I give myself a 5 minute break after that.

## 10:00 AM
By this time, I & the team will meet up online. We talk about what we worked on the day before, what we plan on working on in the current day and whether we have anything thatâ€™s blocking us from completing some of our tasks.

## 12:00 PM
This is the time I eat lunch nom with my family. (I WFH was able to eat my favorite foods and gather with my family for every meal.)

## 13:30 PM
Between 13:30 PM and 17:00 PM, I work on my current tasks & coding.And meetings that are scheduled are within this time frame.

Once I finish my work, I shutdown computer and phone. Working from home can get tiring on some days, so it is good practice to put your work items away once you are done for the day (I recommend that you try it if you havenâ€™t already! ). 

I start to rest and prepare to exercise after a tiring day at work (I realized that after being in one place all day, I need to go out and get some exercise if I want to be in good health.) 

I alternate my gym days with cardio days. The best feeling is showering after a workout. It really gives me comfort & energy to do more activities in the evening.

## 18:40 PM
I have dinner and then I spend some time with my family.

Once those, I take a 30 minute break and keeping up-to-date with my programming skills. After coding & done task done, I keep at least a few minutes just to relax and play games, watch TV, read a book or write an blog. 

I finish the work day and get ready to sleep ... ðŸ˜´
